# About Me

I'm a reformed banker. Finance MBA by education. I've been in software since ~2009, although I started with Basic in elementary school and have taken C/C++/Java and other CS classes in middle/high school/college. Since college, I've been involved in real estate in one way or another (underwriting loans, landlord, or building software).

I have 3 kiddos.

I am stupidly passionate about writing good software.

I will occassionally drop an F-bomb in a meeting.

In software I've worked as a consultant at [Arcweb Technologies](https://arcweb.co/), Lead at [ProctorU](https://proctoru.com), CTO/Cofounder at [TenantLoop](https://angel.co/tenantloop) (acquired), and Director of Engineering - Mobile at [Buildium](https://buildium.com).

# Values

Health First. Family Second. Work Third. Without health, there is no family. With a family in disarray, your work is highly affected. Make sure the first two are in good shape.

I've been sick since 2014 with mercury poisoning so my values above are shaped by that experience.

# My Job

As a director I am usually working at a relatively high level to make sure that we are all moving in roughly the same direction. Ideally we are all doing things consistently in a way that promotes high productivity and fun.

I manage individuals and managers. My degree of involvement varies based on the structure of each team. I can provide a lot of value to mobile and API design so I spend more time there. Other teams have good leadership in place, so I provide mentorship and advice.

# Availability

Generally, I try to block my schedule with meetings in the morning and afternoons to get my head down to work. I use the [Eisenhower matrix](https://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box) to prioritize work. If you need me to work on something to unblock you, please let me know so I can place it in my `Urgent and Important` column.

I work remotely fairly often. This is mostly because my direct reports are in Boston and I have meetings most of the day. I value the flexibility of remote work and generally don't care where you work as long as it doesn't affect your ability to get shit done. There are definite downsides to not being able to tap someone on the shoulder or whiteboard in-real-life, so I think colocation is usually a good thing.

# Assumptions

You are smart. That's why we hired you.

Most likely you are smarter than me! I like that. I'm here to learn too so please teach me something.

Given the above, you will be thrown into the deep end. Let me know if you've reached a limit and we can work to scale back. This is good for self-reflection. 

# How Can I Help?

I believe that leadership is all about serving the people who work for you. That doesn't necessarily mean that I'll do whatever you ask me to do. My objective is to ensure that what you want is aligned with the team's, department's, and company's goals. There may be short and long-term considerations along with UX, marketing, or other stakeholders. You will be in good shape if you can craft a good story/proposal that supports all those things. I can help you create that story/proposal.

Overall, my biggest goal is to develop people. In the past I've had a few great mentors, but few good managers. I try to be the manager that I wish I would have had when I was at other companies.

# Feedback

Ocassionally, I will need to provide constructive or positive feedback. I hate conflict, so constructive feedback is very hard for me to give, although it is essential for a well-functioning team. Please know that me having to give constructive feedback is probably just as hard as you receiving it.

I may not always provide positive feedback when it is warranted. This is probably me not being attentive enough to my teams. If you feel like you deserved or wanted feedback on something, please let me know and I will provide it. This is something I try to get better at!

# Recognition

I don't really like receiving public recognition, but I do... sometimes. Weird right? Tell me how you want to be recognized and I will try my best to abide by your preference!

# One on Ones

Our 1-1s are editable by you. Initially I would insist on 30 minutes (at least) weekly, but we can control cadence as you see fit after the first couple months.

One-on-Ones:
* Shouldn't really be status updates unless you have something you want to share
* Should be directed by you. Have a list of items you want to talk about. Keep a running doc.
* Should be oriented around mid to long term issues, projects, and goals you want to accomplish
* Should be a way for me to learn more about how I can help you progress in your career

# Open and Honest

I'm stupidly transparent. I probably overshare beyond what I'm supposed to.
